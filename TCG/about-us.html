      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="zay">You can call me Zay</p>
      <p>I love MN sports. The Vikings in particular. I chose the donut shift at Amazon so I could watch the games on Sunday. It would be my dream to work for the Vikings or maybe help make a football game. I made this website as a project but I'm sure I'll have another reason down the line. I also dont have a linkedin yet so heres a link to the <a href="https://www.vikings.com">Vikings website</a href>.</p>

      <p>I have a table of the MN stadiums i've been too on my main site. The only ones I still need to get to are The Wild(Hockey), MN united(Soccer) and maybe a couple other ones. I think it would be cool to visit all 30 NFL stadiums.</p>
      <p>I also have my work goals there to. It's good to have you goals written down or documented it gives you that that bit of motivation.</p>

      <p> I wanted to get a better job than Amazon. Don't get me wrong, Amazon is a great place to work. Warehouse labor can do a number on the body. I heard about career choice and thought it was a no brainer. It took me a while to actually take adavntage of it but here I am. Learning and happy to do it.</p>
